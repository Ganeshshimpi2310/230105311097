                </div>

                <p>Savasana, or shavasana is the Sanskrit name for an important restorative asana. It is a key component of asana practice in almost every yoga tradition, and is most commonly used at the end of a sequence as a means of relaxation and integration. Some schools also use it to calm the body and mind at the start of a class, and in both Sivananda and Yoga Therapy it is sometimes practiced between postures in order to calm the nervous system.

                    The term is derived from two Sanskrit roots; shava, meaning "corpse", and asana meaning "seat" or "posture". The first written record of savasana is found in classic 15th-century yoga text, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, which says: “Lying down on the ground, like a corpse, is called savasana. It removes fatigue and gives rest to the mind”.</p>

                    </div>
                
                <p>Salamba sirsasana is a variation of sirsasana (the traditional headstand). It is an inversion that displays strength, control and beauty. Headstands are often considered the “royalty” of asanas.

                    To enter this asana, the practitioner begins in ardha pincha mayurasana (dolphin pose). The crown of the head rests on the mat between the arms and the knees move closer to the torso. The body's weight is shifted from the feet to the head and arms as the torso is aligned vertically. The legs are raised into the air one at a time and are extended fully if the practitioner's stability and core strength allow.
                    
                    The name for this asana comes from the Sanskrit salamba, meaning "with support," sirsa, meaning "head," and asana, meaning "posture." Salamba sirsasana is known as supported headstand in English</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Dandasana is a simple seated posture with the legs straight in front of the body and the spine upright and long. The name comes from the Sanskrit danda which means “stick” or “staff” and asana which means “posture” or “seat.”

                    It is a posture which requires a great deal of awareness and presence to hold and, as such, is considered good for becoming more mindful and focused in one's yoga practice. It also prepares the body and mind for other seated postures.</p>

                        <h2>Halasana</h2>

                    </div>

                    <p>Halasana is a folded inversion, traditionally considered a finishing pose that may be practiced at the end of a yoga session. As a finishing pose, it helps prepare the body for relaxation, pranayama and meditation.

                    To begin, lie down on the ground with arms at the sides and palms pressing down. Lift the legs up to a vertical position. Then lift the hips and spine from the floor, bringing the legs behind the head. The toes are then placed on the floor and the legs are gently straightened.
                    
                    The name comes from the Sanskrit hala meaning "plow," and asana, meaning "pose." Therefore, halasana is also referred to as plow pose in English.</p>
